# Overview

For this project, I put together a game of Hangman using the C++ Coding Language in an attempt to familiarize myself with it.

Like mentioned earlier, this software is a game of Hangman and was crafted in an attempt to familiarize myself with the C++ Coding Language.


4-5 minutes
Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.

# Future Work

- It keeps picking the word "Keyboard" for some reason. Fixing that should be my top priority, if anything.
- Add in a bigger variety of words. Perhaps insert a hint for each different word?
- There might be an easier way to insert the art of the Hangman than putting in seven individual illustrations at the start of the code. Can this be implemented with only one image instead of the seven different ones that were used???
